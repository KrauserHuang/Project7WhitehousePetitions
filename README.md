# 100 Days of Swift - "Whitehouse Petitions" iOS App

Start Date: July 27, 2021
End Date:

I want to learn how to program in Swift language. I will practice coding in Swift for at leasr one hour everyday for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by Hacking with Swift called "Whitehouse Petitions". This is an app to interface with the petitions submitted to "We the people" Whitehouse peitions in the USA. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.
